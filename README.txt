This was a final project in my CSCI101 class

Any file can be used as long as it is named data.tsv and each line is formatted as:
[x value]tab[character]tab[y value]
Where "tab" is replaced with tabs

Be sure you only have one file named data.tsv in the folder at a time when you run the program, lest ye face unpredictable errors and/or results.

the program uses several O(n) complexity algorithms to parse the data, so this program is only viable on smaller scales.
